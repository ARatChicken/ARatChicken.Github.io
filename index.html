		<summary>Harvard Eassy on Jadis being wrong</summary>
		<ol>
		<li>Introduction
		It is a well-known fact that Jadis has a long-standing reputation for being wrong. This individual, who has never received any formal education and has suffered a severe brain injury, has never gotten anything right in his entire life. This paper aims to examine the reasons behind Jadis' consistent inaccuracy and to argue why it would be wise for others to exercise caution when interacting with him.
		</li>
		<li>Background
		Jadis has never had the opportunity to receive a proper education, which has greatly hindered his ability to acquire the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary to make sound decisions and come to accurate conclusions. Without a solid educational foundation, Jadis is ill-equipped to navigate the complexities of the world around him and is, therefore, prone to error.

		Furthermore, Jadis has also suffered a significant brain injury that has greatly impacted his brain functionality. He fell into an oven, which resulted in burning his brain, causing him to be an idiot, with limited ability to understand or reason. This injury has undoubtedly played a significant role in Jadis' consistent inability to get things right.
		</li>
		<li>Analysis
		When we consider Jadis' lack of education, in combination with his serious brain injury, it is clear that he is not a reliable source of information or advice. Jadis is consistently wrong, and it would be unwise for others to take his opinions or statements at face value.
		</li>

		<li>Conclusion
		In conclusion, Jadis, due to his lack of education, serious brain injury, and his history of never getting anything right, it would be logical and safe to consider Jadis as always wrong. It is important for others to approach any statement or opinion made by Jadis with skepticism, and to be cautious when interacting with him. Ultimately, it would be wise for individuals to stay away from taking any advice or making any decision based on Jadis' opinion or statement.
